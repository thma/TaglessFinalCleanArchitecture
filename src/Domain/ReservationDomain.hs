{--
This module implements the business logic for seat reservations in a very small boutique restaurant.
The restaurant has only one table with 20 tables.
Each day the restaurants accepts only 20 seat reservations. (There is no limited time-slot for each guest.)

Please note: all functions in this module are pure and total.
This makes it easy to test them in isolation.
